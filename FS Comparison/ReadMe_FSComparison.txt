This code is written to compare Finkelstein-Schafer Statistic Method with the Method 2 (Synthetic Year Based) 
of my thesis/research work. 

There are 3 parts of this code:
1. FS Statistics: The snippets within this part is to generate a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) using 
FS. Some demo input dataset used for generation of TMY is included.

2. Synthetic Year Generation: The snippets within this part is to create Synthetic Years based on Mean, Median
 and Mode (Most Probable) methods as part of Single Variable Method of my thesis. The input dataset is (naturally) 
the same as the FS method.

3. Metric Comparison: A set of sample codes are written to be able to compare shape and correlation metrics among
the FS and SY years. The sample is shown for a comparison between FS and SYMP method.
